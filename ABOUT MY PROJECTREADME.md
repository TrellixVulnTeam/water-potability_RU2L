# water-potability
CONTEXT
Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection.
This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that
investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health
care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.
